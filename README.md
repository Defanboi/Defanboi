# Hi, I'm @Defanboi (Fedor) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring DevOps engineer and my passion is process automation and scripting.

Now I live in Moscow.

My path in DevOps started with Linux when I installed Ubuntu. I have a basic knowledge of Python, and I have excellent knowledge of Bash, Docker and Nginx. I'm currently studying PostgreSQL in depth.

You can find me on:
